# Datalogger

Datalogger is a power-failure resistant firmware that allows continuous logging of data from external source, which then could be downloaded at the touch of a button. It is implemented on the TI CC2650 LaunchPad, where the data is stored on an external flash, and being downloaded over BLE. 

Here, we demonstrate the Datalogger firmware with another chip, which samples temperature measurements at intervals.

## Installation
The project is based on to TI examples:
* Simple peripheral - Here you should update the files 'main.c', 'simple_peripheral.c', 'simple_peripheral.h'. Also, add to the 'Application' folder the files 'data_service.c', 'data_service.h'
* Pin interrupt - Here you should replace the file 'pinInterrupt.c' with the file 'data_sender.c'
